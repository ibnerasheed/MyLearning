Another example is education level, which can be again assigned any values, but now the order of values matter such as 4 representing the highest level of education.

      "1.\t⁠Unless you have been working for 15+ years, have successfully created and IPOd or sold a startup to a top tech company, or saved an entire country from utter destruction.... you have not done enough to warrant a 2 page resume. Please cut to 1 page. Multipages with your level of experience tells me 1 of 2 things: 1. You are unable to discern important information from not important. 2. You are not sure what story you want to tell about yourself and so you tell me everything.\n",
      "2.\t⁠What story are you trying to tell. Are you applying to be a Machine Learning Scientist/Researcher? If so, expand on your research positions and reduce your MLE role explanations. OR do you want to do more MLE work? In that case, are your two college research positions at the same university? Can you combine them?\n",

They may look for education level, job title, and a few key words. By the time it comes to me, I get maybe 1 or 2 and spend maybe 15 minutes looking through github, resume points, and published papers to decide who I am willing to interview) At other companies, a MLE like me may look at 100s of resumes to do the initial narrowing down. What story are you telling to an HR/recruiter? What story are you telling an experienced MLE/Director?\n",

      "\n",
      "Give your resume a 2 minute look over. What story do you get? Is that the story you want to tell? A resume is a sales pitch. If you are selling a minivan to man starting a construction company, do you tell him how easy it is to tow all his kids and their friends??? or do you tell him how much weight in building materials it can carry and how the seats fold down to provide more space for tools and rocks? Yes the van can do both, but you build the pitch to the customer. In this case... the potential employer is the customer.\n",

      "29/03/22, 5:03:40 PM عادل رشيد: I think its not his fault when majority of firms don’t care about what’s in the black box\n",
      "29/03/22, 5:04:01 PM عادل رشيد: They want something like what do you get when you do certain inputs in certain situations\n",

      "29/03/22, 5:05:50 PM عادل رشيد: But one thing I observed which many will agree due to lack of revision I struggled a bit in some trivial questions\n",
      "29/03/22, 5:06:09 PM عادل رشيد: Like I know what’s huber loss and all but I don’t know types of linear regression\n",
      "29/03/22, 5:06:24 PM عادل رشيد: So we should at least have an idea of such generic questions too\n",

      "11/05/22, 7:55:37 AM عادل رشيد: A/B testing includes hypothesis testing as a component, but generally refers to experimentation in an industry setting where the data is coming from an online process.  While many elements are the same as in other settings (e.g. hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, p-values, power analysis), there are some very important differences because online settings make things weird.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, what should the unit of your experiment be?  Imagine you're at Buzzfeed and testing a UX change to news article pages.  You could choose to show the treatment to logged-in users, but presumably most people who read Buzzfeed articles aren't logged in.  This would limit the generalizability of the experiment.  You could also choose to randomize based on tracking cookie.  You'd get higher volume and a more representative sample, but the same person could end up seeing both the treatment and control experiences!  Like, what if the same person reads Buzzfeed on their desktop computer and their mobile device?  Or if the user opens multiple incognito windows?  If you're a biologist testing how mice respond to a drug in a lab, you know exactly how many mice you have and can ensure you know which treatment(s) each mouse is receiving.  However, if you're testing on cookies, you don't actually know how many people you're testing on.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also a variety of other concerns.  Like, suppose you're testing at Facebook.  The treatment group receives a minor UI change with the goal of improving the number of times they message someone on their friends lists.  But if a treatment group user talks to their friend in the control group, that impacts the number of messages sent by the control group!  A completely random assignment of users would therefore violate the stable unit treatment assumption (SUTVA), which assumes that someone's response to their treatment in the experiment depends only on their own treatment.  Social network websites have published a variety of papers on how to handle this situation, including how to quantify network effects and on how to assign based on trying to ensure network separation between groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, unlike other settings, A/B testing often focuses on whether the percent change was statistically significant because baseline values can be super low (e.g. we might be aiming for a third-decimal point improvement in clickthrough rate like 0.103 -> 0.104).  Unlike for difference of means, there’s no named hypothesis test for percent change.  You also can't divide the confidence interval by the control group values because you're dividing by a random variable and not taking that additional variability into account.  So you need specialized math for percent change calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't even scratched the surface of just how much online A/B testing differs from other experiment settings.  If you want to learn more about A/B testing and online-specific concerns, I highly recommend reading Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments by Kohavi et al.  It's not super technical and is a fantastic introduction.  I've recommended it to new hires with strong stats backgrounds at my current job and they found it really useful for understanding why what we do is different from experimentation in more traditional settings, like behavioral labs or in agriculture.\n",

The sample space then looked like S = {wwww, wbwb, bwbw, …} and the event space looked like E = {wbwb, bwbw, …}.\\n\\nNow answer the following questions:\\n\\n(1) Are the outcomes in the sample space equally likely? Think of it intuitively first and then try to calculate the probability of two outcomes, say ‘wwww ‘and ‘wbwb’, and compare their probabilities.\\n\\n(2) Calculate the probability of event E above. The answer should be the same as what we derived in class: 4C_2 x (4/10)^2 x (6/10)^2. I want to see your thought process in answering this.\\n04/12/21, 00:00:27 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I expect a response from all in class regarding ☝🏾\\n04/12/21, 00:00:41 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : You are encouraged to work in teams and get back with the team member names\\n04/12/21, 00:00:49 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Or individually if you prefer\\n04/12/21, 12:10:01 \\u202a+91\\xa099017\\xa028982\\u202c: \\u200e\\u200eYour security code with \\u202a+91\\xa099017\\xa028982\\u202c changed. \\u200eTap to learn more.\\n05/12/21, 11:13:14 عادل رشيد: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/prathosh-ap-phd-50ab9511_ihb-jm2022pdf-activity-6872553488916738048-qZ1L\\n05/12/21, 20:42:39 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, there was a mistake in link I posted for Friday’s lecture.\\n05/12/21, 20:43:02 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Here is the correct one: https://youtu.be/fj3qE3il6Bo\\n05/12/21, 20:43:52 Yeshwanth ML: Okay sir\\n05/12/21, 20:43:54 Yeshwanth ML: Thank you\\n07/12/21, 10:43:23 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : All project teams using Edge Impulse, please try to get a working impulse design done.

For example, the feature gender is categorical, and the genders can be assigned any values or even letters. Another example is education level, which can be again assigned any values, but now the order of values matter such as 4 representing the highest level of education. How can you accommodate a dataset with such features? That is, how a scores vector can be calculated?

Better late than never.\\n\\n1.\\t\\u2060Unless you have been working for 15+ years, have successfully created and IPOd or sold a startup to a top tech company, or saved an entire country from utter destruction.... you have not done enough to warrant a 2 page resume. Please cut to 1 page. Multipages with your level of experience tells me 1 of 2 things: 1. You are unable to discern important information from not important. 2. You are not sure what story you want to tell about yourself and so you tell me everything.\\n2.\\t\\u2060What story are you trying to tell. Are you applying to be a Machine Learning Scientist/Researcher? If so, expand on your research positions and reduce your MLE role explanations. OR do you want to do more MLE work? In that case, are your two college research positions at the same university? Can you combine them?\\n3.\\t\\u2060Your education section is formatted weirdly. Maybe it is the switch to italics instead of bold.. idk. But it took me too long to find out what your level of education was.\\n4.\\t\\u2060On that note... it is possible your resume may only get 5-30 seconds of being looked at. (at my company, our internal recruiters do this initial look over. They may look for education level, job title, and a few key words. By the time it comes to me, I get maybe 1 or 2 and spend maybe 15 minutes looking through github, resume points, and published papers to decide who I am willing to interview) At other companies, a MLE like me may look at 100s of resumes to do the initial narrowing down. What story are you telling to an HR/recruiter? What story are you telling an experienced MLE/Director?\\n\\nThe story I get is: Big into research, lots of academic experience, some bootstrapping of basic production systems. May struggle in a more corporate environment working with a team. May need the \"academic\" beaten out of him... (I have bad experience working with ACADEMICS who are too focused on what is technically correct and not what provides business value.\\n\\nGive your resume a 2 minute look over. What story do you get? Is that the story you want to tell? A resume is a sales pitch. If you are selling a minivan to man starting a construction company, do you tell him how easy it is to tow all his kids and their friends??? or do you tell him how much weight in building materials it can carry and how the seats fold down to provide more space for tools and rocks? Yes the van can do both, but you build the pitch to the customer. In this case... the potential employer is the customer.\\n\\n5. You say a lot of words without conveying much meaning.\\n\\na. \"Implemented automated tools to simplify the annotation process and monitor annotation quality, increasing annotation quality by about 50%.\"\\n\\nvs\\n\\nb. \"Automated medical annotation process, increasing annotation quality by 50%\"\\n\\nwhich one of those showcases your accomplishments in a succinct way.\\n\\nMost of your descriptions need rewrites.\\n\\n\"Interfaced with clients to ensure the company delivers the desired data\"\\n\\nPlease say \"Communicated with\"... and also what the desired data, how, to what end? This gives me no more information than saying \"communicated with clients\".\\n\\nGive me an action, a process, and a result.\\n\\nDid this thing in this way which produced this (ideally with a metric)\\n\\nCreated a Plotly dashboard to display live NLP analysis of incoming emails generating a 30% increase in email sales conversion.\\n\\nfor example.\\n\\nMake these changes and ping me again and I\\'ll do another look over.\\n\\nOriginal:\\n\\nPosting to remind myself to come back to this. I am an MLE and do the technical interviews for MLE/DS on my team. I don\\'t have time to read this now but will get to it. (If you don\\'t hear from me in 12 hours just comment on this or dm me to remind me to come back and review)\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/jlg345/early_career_machine_learning_engineer_here_what/gap456y/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3\\n17/03/22, 01:10:16 عادل رشيد: Please go through the guidelines too if anyone is going to make his/her/they/them CV\\n\\u200e17/03/22, 01:12:17 عادل رشيد: \\u200eimage omitted\\n\\u200e17/03/22, 01:12:17 عادل رشيد: \\u200eimage omitted\\n17/03/22, 01:15:09 عادل رشيد: Also you can use this link also for the above said format\\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1wdkgpgU7lFoV801ysrBn8qrPaIpyUsUH/mobilebasic\\n17/03/22, 01:16:28 عادل رشيد: Also read through this too\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/wiki/index/faq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf#wiki_building_and_formatting_a_resume_with_little_to_no_work_experience\\n17/03/22, 01:31:01 عادل رشيد: https://pdfhost.io/v/UpUDbA~QE_ResumeAnonpdf.pdf\\n17/03/22, 10:34:49 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, we will have the morning session from 11:30-1:30 and afternoon session from 3-5.

Most companies that come through the recruitment office use those as entrance requirements. Please spend a few hours everyday this week to strengthen your basics to that end. I will address this in person when we meet tomorrow.\\n03/04/22, 13:36:29 عادل رشيد: Okay sir\\n03/04/22, 14:03:13 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I will give a heads up to the next person to join the mock interview meeting\\n03/04/22, 14:03:31 Arpita ML : Okay sir\\n03/04/22, 14:03:57 Baswa: OK sir\\n03/04/22, 14:04:05 \\u202a+91\\xa087928\\xa034306\\u202c: Ok sir\\n03/04/22, 14:43:19 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Link to RL workshop material: https://tinyurl.com/29k46k82\\n03/04/22, 15:57:59 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Thejaswi please join\\n03/04/22, 16:40:26 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Perceptron is like chapter-1 in neural network. Not useful practically! \\n\\nIt is SVM with 0 margin, that is we just draw a hyper plane between the samples with road width 0. Does that make sense?\\n03/04/22, 16:41:06 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : ☝🏾 is about perceptron which is like the 1st page in a neural networks book. We never went through it because it is practically useless. Nevertheless know this just in case.\\n03/04/22, 16:47:25 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : It appears those who have the mock interview today did well on the ML part but were asked to brush up data structures well.

It’s application is a lot of fun though\\n12/04/22, 21:18:37 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Linear algebra will age like old wine. Keep up the momentum; some point, it will be your lens to the world\\n12/04/22, 21:19:46 Yeshwanth ML: Yeah we are like just born now.\\n12/04/22, 21:20:38 عادل رشيد: Im a novice sir\\n12/04/22, 21:20:47 عادل رشيد: Couldn’t agree more\\n12/04/22, 21:21:18 عادل رشيد: Keeping up with linear algebra\\n12/04/22, 21:32:00 Yeshwanth ML: https://youtu.be/JjB58InuTqM\\n12/04/22, 21:32:34 عادل رشيد: Isn’t in this series he used octave or so\\n12/04/22, 21:33:07 Yeshwanth ML: This is very similar mahalanobis distance application\\n12/04/22, 21:33:39 Yeshwanth ML: Not sure I found it randomly\\n12/04/22, 21:33:54 عادل رشيد: Okay\\n12/04/22, 21:34:23 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : It is indeed!\\n12/04/22, 21:34:36 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Good recap of our lecture on multivariate normal distribution\\n12/04/22, 21:34:56 Yeshwanth ML: I believe it’s a part of the machine learning specialisation. He seem to have covered literally everything in that.\\n12/04/22, 21:35:16 Yeshwanth ML: Yes sir we can relate it to our graph\\n12/04/22, 21:35:22 Yeshwanth ML: It’s same\\n12/04/22, 21:36:33 عادل رشيد: Yes its his old ML series\\n12/04/22, 21:44:30 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Old is gold\\n12/04/22, 21:44:39 Yeshwanth ML: 😀\\n12/04/22, 21:44:46 عادل رشيد: Anyday sir\\n12/04/22, 21:46:04 Yeshwanth ML: I just watched both the videos the equation he used is same as mahalanobis distance. It was a good recap. We had seen it much detail in class.\\n12/04/22, 21:46:31 Yeshwanth ML: For some reason he doesn’t use the term mahalanobis\\n12/04/22, 21:46:53 عادل رشيد: Maybe he is jealous of using indian name\\n12/04/22, 21:47:04 Yeshwanth ML: 😂😂😂😂\\n12/04/22, 21:47:26 عادل رشيد: Time to bring back old indian legacy of nalanda and co\\n12/04/22, 21:47:46 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : That’s true Yeshwanth. He is using the idea of the joint PDF directly to estimate outliers. But that boils down to the same as what we did with Mahalanobis distance\\n12/04/22, 21:48:03 Senthil Jacob George: Takshashila\\n12/04/22, 21:48:09 Yeshwanth ML: Ohh okay sir\\n12/04/22, 21:48:23 عادل رشيد: Indus valley\\n12/04/22, 21:48:28 عادل رشيد: Okay sir\\n12/04/22, 21:48:32 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : An interesting idea would be take Yeshwanth’s code for embedding categorical variables and then look at the distribution of the newly formed features. Even if they are not normal, MD can give some insight into outliers\\n12/04/22, 21:48:56 عادل رشيد: Okay sir\\n12/04/22, 21:49:11 Yeshwanth ML: Yeah I’ll share the code here sir.

They will be just fixed entries from the generated embedding replacing each of the discrete categorical variables. What am I missing sir?\\n12/04/22, 21:55:05 Yeshwanth ML: using these weights to create a columns was a challenge though\\n12/04/22, 21:55:17 Yeshwanth ML: scraped it from nobroker\\n12/04/22, 21:55:26 عادل رشيد: Oh nice\\n12/04/22, 21:56:08 Yeshwanth ML: Yeah.

Or may not even in that case. Was referring to that\\n12/04/22, 21:56:26 عادل رشيد: But I’ll try this on mice dataset\\n12/04/22, 21:56:48 Srikanth Shenoy: Ok sir. understood 🙏\\n12/04/22, 21:57:16 Yeshwanth ML: yeah some categories had 10 values. so it might have a gaussian distribution.\\n12/04/22, 21:58:22 Suraksha Rao: Okay sir, will go through the code\\n12/04/22, 22:00:16 Srikanth Shenoy: R has this one liner function call to test normality - Shapiro Wilk test.

The company is trying to be \"Spring Framework\" of Machine Learning.\\ni.e. they are developing a layer on top of all other ML tools, integrating them together, reducing the learning curve and complexity....thus provide a wrapper from step 1 - data ingestion till last step - deployment, execution, observabilty, MLOps and for everything in between (perhaps both on and off cloud) as one stop shop.\\nso that other companies that are just starting on ML with less experienced and less paid staff can buy Couture product and will be able to deploy ML models in production in cloud easily in a well defined manner using the best practices based implementation ingrained in the Couture product\\n\\nThis job is ideal for somebody who is interested in touching all aspects of machine learning lifecycle from a software development lifecycle perspective (but not from actually doing machine learning from a day to day perspective) . There will be lots of coding and tool integration using open source and propreitary APIs\\nTheir product does multi source data ingestion, big data with Spark, serious software development in multiple languages, developing tools for the cloud, deploying on the cloud using the tools that hook onto AWS/GCP/Azure etc. ML Tool Intergration and a readymade and stable ML tool chain setup seems to be their USP\\n04/05/22, 22:17:28 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Awesome Sir, this is super helpful\\n04/05/22, 22:22:39 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : This looks like a sophisticated pipeline job cutting across different software; I hope folks interested I this get a chance here. 🙏🏿 Sir\\n04/05/22, 22:25:01 Srikanth Shenoy: Prospects also look good sir.

While many elements are the same as in other settings (e.g. hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, p-values, power analysis), there are some very important differences because online settings make things weird.\\n\\nFor example, what should the unit of your experiment be?  Imagine you\\'re at Buzzfeed and testing a UX change to news article pages.  You could choose to show the treatment to logged-in users, but presumably most people who read Buzzfeed articles aren\\'t logged in.  This would limit the generalizability of the experiment.  You could also choose to randomize based on tracking cookie.  You\\'d get higher volume and a more representative sample, but the same person could end up seeing both the treatment and control experiences!  Like, what if the same person reads Buzzfeed on their desktop computer and their mobile device?  Or if the user opens multiple incognito windows?  If you\\'re a biologist testing how mice respond to a drug in a lab, you know exactly how many mice you have and can ensure you know which treatment(s) each mouse is receiving.  However, if you\\'re testing on cookies, you don\\'t actually know how many people you\\'re testing on.\\n\\nThere are also a variety of other concerns.  Like, suppose you\\'re testing at Facebook.  The treatment group receives a minor UI change with the goal of improving the number of times they message someone on their friends lists.  But if a treatment group user talks to their friend in the control group, that impacts the number of messages sent by the control group!  A completely random assignment of users would therefore violate the stable unit treatment assumption (SUTVA), which assumes that someone\\'s response to their treatment in the experiment depends only on their own treatment.  Social network websites have published a variety of papers on how to handle this situation, including how to quantify network effects and on how to assign based on trying to ensure network separation between groups.\\n\\nAlso, unlike other settings, A/B testing often focuses on whether the percent change was statistically significant because baseline values can be super low (e.g. we might be aiming for a third-decimal point improvement in clickthrough rate like 0.103 -> 0.104).  Unlike for difference of means, there’s no named hypothesis test for percent change.  You also can\\'t divide the confidence interval by the control group values because you\\'re dividing by a random variable and not taking that additional variability into account.  So you need specialized math for percent change calculations.\\n\\nI haven\\'t even scratched the surface of just how much online A/B testing differs from other experiment settings.  If you want to learn more about A/B testing and online-specific concerns, I highly recommend reading Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments by Kohavi et al.  It\\'s not super technical and is a fantastic introduction.  I\\'ve recommended it to new hires with strong stats backgrounds at my current job and they found it really useful for understanding why what we do is different from experimentation in more traditional settings, like behavioral labs or in agriculture.\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/umlf7e/what_is_the_difference_between_ab_testing_and/i83p3uo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3\\n11/05/22, 15:35:02 Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : We will have an in-lab RL problem & coding session tomorrow from 10:30-12:30.
