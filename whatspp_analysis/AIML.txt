23/10/21, 12:12:13 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Good job Yeshwanth. You can write the formula as nC_k x kC_j = nC_j x (n-j)C_(k-j). The left-hand side means, we select k out of n students for the committee AND j out of those k students for the sub-committee. The right-hand side means, we first select j out n students for the sub-committee AND then from the remaining n-j students select the remaining k-j members for the committee
23/10/21, 12:12:45 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : The difference between the left-hand and right-hand sides is the order in which we select the committee and the sub-committee

22/11/21, 6:41:38 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : ☝🏾 compulsory video assignment. Watch it for a simple example of mean (also known as expected value or average) and variance calculation. The video does not explain the intuitive meaning of the expected value. I want each one of you to get back with an intuitive meaning of the expected value and standard deviation of the random variable described in the video.

03/12/21, 9:10:26 PM Srikanth Shenoy: ok sir
03/12/21, 11:59:54 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Quick quiz: in class today, we abstracted the sampling space for the 4 white & 10 black balls problem as s = {w, b} and the probability array as p = {4/10, 6/10}. The sample space then looked like S = {wwww, wbwb, bwbw, …} and the event space looked like E = {wbwb, bwbw, …}.

Now answer the following questions:

(1) Are the outcomes in the sample space equally likely? Think of it intuitively first and then try to calculate the probability of two outcomes, say ‘wwww ‘and ‘wbwb’, and compare their probabilities.

(2) Calculate the probability of event E above. The answer should be the same as what we derived in class: 4C_2 x (4/10)^2 x (6/10)^2. I want to see your thought process in answering this.
04/12/21, 12:00:27 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I expect a response from all in class regarding ☝🏾
04/12/21, 12:00:41 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : You are encouraged to work in teams and get back with the team member names

12/12/21, 12:37:57 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Gait team: build an impulse design that uses a cellphone's accelerometer; on Tuesday, I'd like to see a real-time reading of accelerometer data while the cellphone is kept inside the pant pocket. Use the classification setup: normal vs. abnormal gait. While training, artificially train with abnormal gait patterns and the usual (normal) gait patterns
12/12/21, 12:40:32 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Drone team: build an impulse design that uses a cellphone's camera; on Tuesday, I'd like to see a real-time reading of camera data while the cellphone is kept at an elevated height. Use the classification setup: garbage hotspot vs. no garbage. While training, artificially train with garbage items such as plastic covers, bottles etc., and train from an elevated height.
12/12/21, 12:41:51 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Light team: investigate what sensor and board could be used for collecting light data. Check if the edge impulse code could be flashed to the boards that you will have shortlisted.

12/12/21, 1:18:33 PM عادل رشيد: Okay sir
12/12/21, 1:18:34 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : The dataset that I will simulate for you will be far more complicated'
12/12/21, 1:21:09 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Have a look at the UCI dataset and do the following: add a column called gender and randomly fill in gender data (male/female/unknown) for all the samples. You can use P(male) = 0.6, P(female) = 0.3, P(Unknown) = 0.1. You will find the numpy.random library helpful. Next, randomly remove data across the entire dataset. After this, follow the code I posted for the survival team which includes reading+wrangling+imputing missing data, and apply it to your blood donor data set

12/12/21, 9:40:03 PM Senthil Jacob George: Ok sir
12/12/21, 9:46:01 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Some common missteps are: (1) applying a multiplication immediately for an AND probability (2) not realizing that the law of total probability can be used to calculate AND probabilities (3)  Figuring out what conditional probability is given (4) Getting the sampling and sample space correct (this was the trickiest part in 3(a) and 3(b), and only two of you got close to solving it correctly)
12/12/21, 9:51:40 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : As I said, this is a check point; everybody will have an opportunity to score 2 additional points by demonstrating an appropriate learning. I will add those points during the final (which is also a guarantee that nobody will score full points on the final!). I will explain the procedure tomorrow.
13/12/21, 10:46:26 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, we will start lecture at sharp 11:15

22/12/21, 12:58:34 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Challenge question: The difference between the 75th and 50th percentiles is called the inter quartile range (IQR), which is a measure of how spread the middle 50% of the data is. Larger the IQR, more spread the middle 50% of the data is. The standard deviation is a measure of how spread each data point is around the mean calculated using *all* data points. Calculate the IQR and standard deviation of the following two datasets and comment on when you would use what: the IQR or standard deviation:

(1) 65, 68, 70, 74, 75, 76, 76, 80, 84

(2) 65, 68, 70, 74, 75, 76, 76, 80, 84, 180

Read about the StandardScaler() and RobustScaler() functions in Python and relate it to your answer.

(1) There will be an AAPS workshop on Saturday, March 5. Will confirm regarding that on Wednesday.

(2) The 10-day DL workshop will run from March 7-11 and 14-18, 10 AM-1 PM & 2:30-5:30 PM.

(3) RL, MLPA lectures will begin after the DO workshop. In some sense, the material you will learn in the DL workshop will form the foundation for RL and MLPA.

(3) The DL workshop will be held on campus in the lab(s). Sessions will be recorded as always but I will expect all of you to be physically present and actively participate.
28/02/22, 11:01:58 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Together, let us rock it!

07/03/22, 8:35:59 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, hope you enjoyed the workshop today. As a simple exercise, please see how many lines of code would correspond to the Softmax loss (categorical cross entropy loss) calculation if you are provided with the data matrix X.

The simplicity of codes like this should reveal the power of linear algebra and programming languages built on the principles of vectorised operations.

10/03/22, 8:27:58 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Watch the above excellent video on regularization in the context of regression. Tomorrow, I will expect some of you how this applies to what we saw regarding L1 and L2 regularization
10/03/22, 8:56:26 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Adil asked an excellent question today: how can we incorporate categorical features into the softmax and SVM algorithms we have implemented. For example, the feature gender is categorical, and the genders can be assigned any values or even letters. Another example is education level, which can be again assigned any values, but now the order of values matter such as 4 representing the highest level of education. How can you accommodate a dataset with such features? That is, how a scores vector can be calculated? Hint: ordinal encoding and one-hot encoding
10/03/22, 8:56:57 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Get back to me with your answers via PM (audio message is also fine)

14/03/22, 6:13:45 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Ok sir
14/03/22, 7:25:33 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : True/False: It is possible to add a new datapoint to a training set that would leave the SVM loss unchanged, but this is not the case with the Softmax classifier loss
14/03/22, 7:25:40 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : PM me your answer
14/03/22, 7:27:26 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : For Softmax, if we randomly initialize the weights, why is the loss for a sample approximately -log(0.1)?
14/03/22, 7:29:29 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : True/False: It is possible to remove a datapoint to a training set that would leave the SVM loss unchanged
14/03/22, 7:49:22 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Which samples contribute to the SVM loss?
14/03/22, 7:50:25 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Good. If the weights are random, how likely is Softmax predict that a sample belongs to its correct loss given that there are 10 categories?
14/03/22, 7:50:54 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Ok, above message was for someone else. FOr the -log(0,1) question, assume there are 10 losses
15/03/22, 5:26:29 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Read the first chapter here quickly. You can skip the discussion on logical gates. Completing this chapter should give you a well-rounded picture of what we are doing and where we are headed:

17/03/22, 1:09:26 AM عادل رشيد: Thanks to shenoy sir for inputs regarding the CV pattern given us by the university
17/03/22, 1:09:45 AM عادل رشيد: Edit: Well I forgot.. but here it is. Better late than never.

1.	⁠Unless you have been working for 15+ years, have successfully created and IPOd or sold a startup to a top tech company, or saved an entire country from utter destruction.... you have not done enough to warrant a 2 page resume. Please cut to 1 page. Multipages with your level of experience tells me 1 of 2 things: 1. You are unable to discern important information from not important. 2. You are not sure what story you want to tell about yourself and so you tell me everything.
2.	⁠What story are you trying to tell. Are you applying to be a Machine Learning Scientist/Researcher? If so, expand on your research positions and reduce your MLE role explanations. OR do you want to do more MLE work? In that case, are your two college research positions at the same university? Can you combine them?
3.	⁠Your education section is formatted weirdly. Maybe it is the switch to italics instead of bold.. idk. But it took me too long to find out what your level of education was.
4.	⁠On that note... it is possible your resume may only get 5-30 seconds of being looked at. (at my company, our internal recruiters do this initial look over. They may look for education level, job title, and a few key words. By the time it comes to me, I get maybe 1 or 2 and spend maybe 15 minutes looking through github, resume points, and published papers to decide who I am willing to interview) At other companies, a MLE like me may look at 100s of resumes to do the initial narrowing down. What story are you telling to an HR/recruiter? What story are you telling an experienced MLE/Director?

The story I get is: Big into research, lots of academic experience, some bootstrapping of basic production systems. May struggle in a more corporate environment working with a team. May need the "academic" beaten out of him... (I have bad experience working with ACADEMICS who are too focused on what is technically correct and not what provides business value.

Give your resume a 2 minute look over. What story do you get? Is that the story you want to tell? A resume is a sales pitch. If you are selling a minivan to man starting a construction company, do you tell him how easy it is to tow all his kids and their friends??? or do you tell him how much weight in building materials it can carry and how the seats fold down to provide more space for tools and rocks? Yes the van can do both, but you build the pitch to the customer. In this case... the potential employer is the customer.

5. You say a lot of words without conveying much meaning.

a. "Implemented automated tools to simplify the annotation process and monitor annotation quality, increasing annotation quality by about 50%."

vs

b. "Automated medical annotation process, increasing annotation quality by 50%"

which one of those showcases your accomplishments in a succinct way.

Most of your descriptions need rewrites.

"Interfaced with clients to ensure the company delivers the desired data"

Please say "Communicated with"... and also what the desired data, how, to what end? This gives me no more information than saying "communicated with clients".

Give me an action, a process, and a result.

Did this thing in this way which produced this (ideally with a metric)

Created a Plotly dashboard to display live NLP analysis of incoming emails generating a 30% increase in email sales conversion.

for example.

Make these changes and ping me again and I'll do another look over.

Posting to remind myself to come back to this. I am an MLE and do the technical interviews for MLE/DS on my team. I don't have time to read this now but will get to it. (If you don't hear from me in 12 hours just comment on this or dm me to remind me to come back and review)

17/03/22, 10:34:49 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, we will have the morning session from 11:30-1:30 and afternoon session from 3-5. See you all soon.
17/03/22, 10:35:21 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Please complete the assignment and go through the SVM code in the Codes/ folder
17/03/22, 6:14:46 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, please read this ☝🏾during the break
17/03/22, 6:21:58 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Read the SVC documentation https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html

do the following, and PM me your answers: identify all the hyperparameters for each of Linear, RBF and Poly kernels, and for each kernel state the optimal hyperparameter values, test data accuracy, and number of support vectors. Finally, determine which model you would select. This you can do on the make_blob() non-linearly separable data we saw in class today.
17/03/22, 7:04:44 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : For the motivated folks, run the SVC with hyper parameter tuning for the diabetes data set available in the Data/ folder
17/03/22, 7:05:02 PM عادل رشيد: Okay sir
17/03/22, 7:05:15 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Also, some of you missed the session this afternoon on grid search and cross validation; these are important practical techniques. Make sure to follow up.
17/03/22, 7:40:38 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hello Sir. Hope you are keeping well. 

VuNet had sent me to Mumbai to a client’s location along with my colleague and an architect to work on and showcase some usecases of their platform like anomaly detection, capacity forecasting and two custom usecases for network experience metrics. 
Client is the ```largest bank in India``` in-terms of size. 
It was a unique opportunity, enjoyed the pressure for a week. Got first hand glimpse of how customer environments would be and what they expect. 

My realization was that ML is understood by some clients as some sort of magic which gives accurate results. 😀 

Got valuable feed back from the demo overall. this feed back will be helpful for me to build a capacity planning module/system on which I am currently expected to work on in VuNet.
17/03/22, 7:40:59 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : ☝🏾 from your senior interning now
17/03/22, 8:29:54 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : MLPA Video Assignment: watch this amazing short video series on SVM which will complete the picture we were discussing today. Treat this exercise seriously:

But yeah they help in getting hired (those who join their courses ) in getting placed at marquee fintechs and all. So it’s a good questionnaire to get the idea what kind of questions we can expect from HRs and all.
17/03/22, 11:02:19 PM عادل رشيد: Also go through the whole machine learning questions. They are well compiled and can ask as refresher before interviews.
17/03/22, 11:02:31 PM عادل رشيد: *act as

(2) Tuesday 4-6 PM
(3) Wednesday 2:30-5:30 PM
(4) Thursday 10 AM-12 PM, 4-6 PM
(5) Friday 2:30-5:30 PM

Note that you will have the CNN lecture next Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9-10:30 AM. Prof. Keerthana will confirm you the timings again.

Prof. Raghavendra Prabhu will take over the DL sessions from the week of March 28.   I will, however, be interacting with you separately on DL topics as usual.

The best way you can support me in teaching is to attend the workshops, ask questions, help others, and work on the assignments as and when I post them. I’m happy to see few of you do that till now; I hope the others will follow suit as well.

Also, I’m curious if anyone cracked the gradient assignment today.
25/03/22, 12:20:56 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, I have posted video links for MLPA Workshop-4 and Deep Learning Workshop-10.

Note that in the MLPA workshop today, we continued with the StatQuest YouTube videos on polynomial and rbf kernel for SVM. We did not record that part though.

In the DL workshop, we discussed the assignment setup. I’m happy that there is one of you who has almost cracked it. Others, I want you to try.

25/03/22, 12:44:02 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Senthil’s alacrity is admirable
25/03/22, 12:49:32 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Has Adil dozed off in the workshop?
25/03/22, 12:49:40 PM عادل رشيد: Sir im in my room now
25/03/22, 12:49:42 PM عادل رشيد: 😂😂😂
25/03/22, 12:49:55 PM Srikanth Shenoy: He didn't even attend. One of the best decisions
25/03/22, 12:49:55 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Good for you!
25/03/22, 12:50:10 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : 😃
25/03/22, 12:50:11 PM عادل رشيد: Top of the game always. Unorophete
25/03/22, 12:50:17 PM عادل رشيد: *unprophete
25/03/22, 12:50:58 PM عادل رشيد: So will there be class today sir or it’s off?
25/03/22, 12:56:08 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I just spoke to our director, and she feels that it might help to attend the afternoon session today, and then communicate to the organisers that the workshop may not be helpful to you
25/03/22, 12:56:33 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : So can you all please motivate yourselves to attend the afternoon session today? I’d much appreciate it
25/03/22, 12:56:46 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : This is mainly to establish a connect with Deutsche Bank, apparently
25/03/22, 12:57:08 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Tomorrow, we will have an intense AAPS workshop to churn your minds!
25/03/22, 12:58:10 PM عادل رشيد: This 🔥! Game on sir !
25/03/22, 1:00:20 PM عادل رشيد: Will deutche come to hire us sir
25/03/22, 1:04:58 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Ok sir
25/03/22, 1:07:02 PM Srikanth Shenoy: All sessions are virtual via Teams. There is hardly any coordinating person in the ICT seminar hall that can mediate with the presenter and those that are physically present. The best way to interact may be by posting questions in Teams session. Will attend in the afternoon in Teams
25/03/22, 1:11:43 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : That sounds better Sir. Please attend the afternoon session via Teams and see if you can get some mileage out of the discussions
25/03/22, 1:12:09 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Yes Adil, but I know that the team presenting here is not the core ML team
25/03/22, 1:12:35 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Nevertheless it is always good to know what transpires on the industry side
25/03/22, 1:13:24 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : All said, I want to see the gradient answers from each one of you. I do see that some are not regular to the workshops; please catch up on the material asap.
25/03/22, 1:13:40 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : A more challenging assignment will follow!

25/03/22, 3:50:19 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Anyone interested in “real” ML stuff, consider applying to this internship
25/03/22, 3:50:39 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Refer the name Hanu Sravanth (your senior) in the email
25/03/22, 3:50:50 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Interested students can send me their CV : kushal.shah@elucidata.io
25/03/22, 3:52:55 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : The concerned person is a physicist looking at folks who want to get to the bottom of deep learning models for NLP
25/03/22, 4:15:25 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Anything helpful came out of the Deutsche Bank workshop afternoon session?
25/03/22, 4:16:01 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Looks like the workshop speakers are narrating incidents or covering ABC's of ML at the level that was covered in first semester (or even less sometimes) using the same examples like Grokking Machine Learning
25/03/22, 4:16:57 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Linear Regression for House price prediction.
Whether a student can be admitted to college or not using Logistic Regression
25/03/22, 4:18:57 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Sir, my profound apologies for having you and others sit through this. I had a feeling it would be superficial treatment of ML.

Anyways, that is an indication that real ML stuff in industries happen in focused startups (like VuNet, SportsAI, the one that I shared) or with the biggies like Google, Microsoft research labs
25/03/22, 4:19:16 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Thankfully such startup’s showed up last last year
25/03/22, 4:19:34 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I’m hopeful that many of you will get placed in rewarding internships
25/03/22, 4:30:49 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Sir, It is absolutely fine. 
You and Keerthana ma'am had the best intentions. If it had been good, we would have benefitted a lot
25/03/22, 5:08:23 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : 🙏🏿 Sir

25/03/22, 6:55:49 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : NLP is a cool application area for deep learning models. There is new stuff related to features but the loss formulation, optimisation etc remains the same as we have seen so far.

Have a look at the above PDF. If you can understand the intro part and solve, even partially, from (a) through (e), you will have demonstrated an an excellent understanding of the material we have covered so far. Such skills are typically expected of a machine learning engineer as evinced in the job description I posted above

26/03/22, 10:26:02 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : This is a wonderful lecture. Please go through this and you will be able to follow a lot of things that we have discussed so far but in the context of natural language processing.
26/03/22, 10:26:34 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I am very happy that you are all spending your Saturday evening and night learning more the planning related stuff
26/03/22, 10:26:51 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I am impress
27/03/22, 12:02:50 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Only few of you have gotten back to me on this. I’d like everyone to take help if needed, work on this, and get back to me
27/03/22, 12:04:56 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Also, those who finished this, please think of a deeper layer neural network: input 3 features, 1st hidden layer with 2 nodes, 2nd hidden layer with 2 nodes, and output layer with one node. Derive the gradient of L w.r.t. W^1_1. You will see that the derivation is straight forward following your answer from the previous problem in a recursive manner. If you can show me this, I’d be much impressed.
27/03/22, 12:05:12 AM عادل رشيد: Okay sir
27/03/22, 12:05:45 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Also, for those who got back to me on the NLP problem and regarding Gowers distance, I’ll get back tomorrow. Our son is just not letting me sit in front of the computer 😀

‎27/03/22, 12:15:53 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : ‎image omitted
27/03/22, 12:17:54 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : There are some minor corrections above. The I(z^1_1 > 0) should read as Diag(I(z^1_1 > 0)).
I have already explained this to some of you; for others, we will see it next week
27/03/22, 10:49:45 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Those who received my Teams invite for a mock interview this afternoon, Please note that it has been postponed to Wednesday.

29/03/22, 4:56:00 PM عادل رشيد: So feedback given to me was “im too technical” and I should emphasise more on coding. Also I shouldn’t elaborate deep
29/03/22, 4:56:07 PM عادل رشيد: Yes I know
29/03/22, 4:56:29 PM عادل رشيد: So I gracefully accepted those remarks and I need to be more basic
29/03/22, 4:56:32 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Did you confuse the interviewer or convince? 😀
29/03/22, 4:56:47 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : 😀 I’m proud of you Adil, you have channelled your inner Gauss and Euler
29/03/22, 4:56:56 PM عادل رشيد: I went into huber loss and convex optimisation
29/03/22, 4:57:06 PM عادل رشيد: So he came back with “what is pca”
29/03/22, 4:57:34 PM عادل رشيد: Hahaha yeah I know im bad at coding so I defined the course of interview lol
29/03/22, 4:57:36 PM Alifa Shaikh: True. Even yesterday they asked this
29/03/22, 4:57:47 PM عادل رشيد: Oh really
29/03/22, 4:58:01 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : As you all may have observed, folks from the industry hover around few topics: regression, PCA etc
29/03/22, 4:58:04 PM عادل رشيد: So he asked about svm and I said what sir has taught
29/03/22, 4:58:12 PM عادل رشيد: Omg yes sir
29/03/22, 4:58:16 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : That is quasi machine learning
29/03/22, 4:58:19 PM عادل رشيد: They don’t even listen properly
29/03/22, 4:58:36 PM عادل رشيد: I wss so enthusiastic to tell
More mathematical explanation
29/03/22, 4:58:44 PM عادل رشيد: And he was back to why pca
29/03/22, 4:59:01 PM عادل رشيد: And how many types of linear regression are there which I didn’t know
29/03/22, 4:59:06 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : You will of course come across mathematically inclined interviewers who will wash you inside out. Gotta be watchful!
29/03/22, 4:59:24 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : By that they mean regularised be usual regression
29/03/22, 4:59:32 PM عادل رشيد: I talked about huber and no question was talked back. I told about quad one and no questions are asked
29/03/22, 4:59:37 PM عادل رشيد: Okk
29/03/22, 4:59:44 PM Srikanth Shenoy: May be he was expecting plain vanilla LR, Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net
29/03/22, 4:59:48 PM عادل رشيد: Yes I know
29/03/22, 4:59:53 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : See, interviews where they ask you to “define algorithms” are basically not testing you at all
29/03/22, 5:00:02 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Different types and things like that
29/03/22, 5:00:07 PM عادل رشيد: I just said I don’t know because I really don’t know how many types of linear regression is there
29/03/22, 5:00:20 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : That’s right Sir
29/03/22, 5:00:25 PM عادل رشيد: Yes sir he said define svm which was difficult for me to tell lol
29/03/22, 5:00:34 PM Alifa Shaikh: Yes sir. 
Knn, sampling techniques, regression, svm & basic machine learning topics
29/03/22, 5:00:38 PM عادل رشيد: Although I explained everything from hyperplane and all
29/03/22, 5:00:43 PM عادل رشيد: Basics I mean
29/03/22, 5:01:07 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I will be happy to hear from your experiences once you give an interview with somebody who does real machine learning
29/03/22, 5:01:18 PM عادل رشيد: I felt like I was in certain machine learning teacher class who wanted to hear his own definitions . Proper deja vu
29/03/22, 5:01:38 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Nevertheless, we should be thankful to the alumna for taking time to share his perspective.
29/03/22, 5:01:38 PM Alifa Shaikh: True
29/03/22, 5:01:40 PM عادل رشيد: Yes sir but I think I have to organise more and be precise
29/03/22, 5:01:56 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Days of definitions are over for you guys
29/03/22, 5:02:04 PM عادل رشيد: Yes he was very good and he really told what industry asking from us
29/03/22, 5:02:09 PM عادل رشيد: Well I hope so
29/03/22, 5:02:14 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Awesome
29/03/22, 5:02:16 PM عادل رشيد: Its PTSD for me
29/03/22, 5:02:21 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : 😀
29/03/22, 5:02:54 PM عادل رشيد: So he asked about coding and all too which somehow i told but I need to focus on that and he said we should explore more beyond class which I agree regarding coding
29/03/22, 5:03:04 PM عادل رشيد: So the senior was really a nice person which I agree
29/03/22, 5:03:16 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Nice to hear that
29/03/22, 5:03:40 PM عادل رشيد: I think its not his fault when majority of firms don’t care about what’s in the black box
29/03/22, 5:04:01 PM عادل رشيد: They want something like what do you get when you do certain inputs in certain situations
29/03/22, 5:04:09 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : But you guys are not the majority but the solid minority.
29/03/22, 5:04:33 PM عادل رشيد: But thanks to you sir GLRM is something I was really going all guns blazing
29/03/22, 5:04:47 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hopefully many of you, like your last year seniors, will end up in core ML roles
29/03/22, 5:04:55 PM عادل رشيد: Yes sir hopefully
29/03/22, 5:04:55 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : 👏🏿
29/03/22, 5:05:50 PM عادل رشيد: But one thing I observed which many will agree due to lack of revision I struggled a bit in some trivial questions
29/03/22, 5:06:09 PM عادل رشيد: Like I know what’s huber loss and all but I don’t know types of linear regression
29/03/22, 5:06:24 PM عادل رشيد: So we should at least have an idea of such generic questions too
29/03/22, 5:06:43 PM عادل رشيد: The pdf of great learning will come handy in such situations
29/03/22, 5:07:26 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I agree
29/03/22, 5:08:30 PM Yeshwanth ML: Simple linear regressor - one independent variable
multiple linear regressor - multiple independent variables or features
29/03/22, 5:09:04 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Oh that kind of a difference 😃
29/03/22, 5:09:19 PM Yeshwanth ML: yes sir😂
29/03/22, 5:09:26 PM Yeshwanth ML: soo many details to remember
29/03/22, 5:09:44 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Well at the end of the day it boils down to what you can do with what you know
29/03/22, 5:10:17 PM Yeshwanth ML: yeah correct sir. formula is what we have to know
29/03/22, 5:10:42 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Alrighty folks, I’ll see you tomorrow. In the mean time, if I can squeeze in, I’ll share an assignment relevant for tomorrow’s discussion
29/03/22, 5:11:23 PM Yeshwanth ML: okay sir.
29/03/22, 5:13:51 PM Yeshwanth ML: sir for svm can you share some material, where the mathematics is explained, like how we use the kernal trick - how the dot product relates to the constraint in the duel equation. it's a bit confusing.
29/03/22, 5:14:57 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Please see this 
https://1drv.ms/b/s!AjTcbXuSD3I3guBvgsNWPL_OpwEalw
29/03/22, 5:15:07 PM Yeshwanth ML: Thank you sir
29/03/22, 5:15:39 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : The dot product shows up on the dual objective function that we want to minimise right?
29/03/22, 5:16:25 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : The constraint in the dual problem is very simple, sum of alpha^(i)*y^(i)=0
29/03/22, 5:16:57 PM Yeshwanth ML: okay sir
29/03/22, 5:22:39 PM عادل رشيد: Bruh really? So he asked you too?
29/03/22, 5:23:14 PM Yeshwanth ML: mine not yet done, I think 2 more are remaining
29/03/22, 5:23:39 PM عادل رشيد: Okk
29/03/22, 5:29:32 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, just a remainder that you are welcome, and urged, to reach out to me if any of the concepts are flying over the head. Compile your questions and get back to me. Discuss your questions with others and listen to theirs as well. That will be an amazing learning environment
29/03/22, 5:29:45 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I understand SVM is still a bit hazy for a majority of you
29/03/22, 5:29:46 PM عادل رشيد: Okay sir
29/03/22, 5:29:56 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Compile your questions tomorrow and let me know in person
29/03/22, 5:30:00 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : We will discuss it together
29/03/22, 5:30:04 PM Yeshwanth ML: Yes sir
29/03/22, 5:30:08 PM عادل رشيد: Yes sir I am not able to comprehend that question well although I tried understanding it
29/03/22, 5:30:24 PM عادل رشيد: One more suggestion sir can you make one or two questions in class
29/03/22, 5:30:27 PM Yeshwanth ML: I'll go through this by night and ask if I have any doubts
29/03/22, 5:30:38 PM عادل رشيد: Its a good ppt bro you should
29/03/22, 5:30:37 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : 👍
29/03/22, 5:30:51 PM عادل رشيد: I mean svm ones
29/03/22, 5:31:04 PM عادل رشيد: So that we get to understand how to approach svm questions
29/03/22, 5:31:12 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Adil, you mean practice questions?
29/03/22, 5:31:17 PM عادل رشيد: Yes sir
29/03/22, 5:31:16 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : On SVM?
29/03/22, 5:31:20 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Will do
29/03/22, 5:31:47 PM عادل رشيد: Yes sir one question will be enough because I wasn’t able to move one step in that question which means im struggling in that
29/03/22, 5:32:03 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Which question are you referring to here?
29/03/22, 5:32:14 PM عادل رشيد: That one you sent yesterday
29/03/22, 5:32:42 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Oh ok, that was meant to challenge you guys. The main intention was how you feel when the notation, language is slightly different
29/03/22, 5:32:54 PM عادل رشيد: Okay sir
29/03/22, 5:33:16 PM Yeshwanth ML: Thank you sir
29/03/22, 5:33:17 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : We will discuss them tomorrow

29/03/22, 5:36:47 PM Yeshwanth ML: 🙏
29/03/22, 5:54:11 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Following Srikanth Sir’s idea, could one of you compile all the questions on SVM and share it with me as a single document please?
29/03/22, 5:54:27 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Any question at all about SVM
29/03/22, 5:56:36 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Similarly another document on deep learning

29/03/22, 7:30:16 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, 2 form 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 27 shared your mock interview experience with me. May I ask the others please also to do the same via PM?
29/03/22, 7:30:55 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : He asked when would we consider outliers, like we don't discard them
29/03/22, 7:31:14 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Above is an interesting question from the mock interview today about when you will not neglect outliers
29/03/22, 7:32:57 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : To that end, can you think in the context of SVM, a sample that is an outlier as well as the *only* support vector? Think of a two dimensional data set. You can PM me your answer or sketch
29/03/22, 8:54:10 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Nobody saw this?
29/03/22, 8:59:03 PM Musab: Yes sir

30/03/22, 6:57:01 PM Yeshwanth ML: Can we directly use a neural network on images instead of cnn. What are the disadvantages
30/03/22, 6:57:25 PM Yeshwanth ML: These were the questions that were asked in mock interview 🙏✌️
30/03/22, 7:07:06 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Thanks Yeshwanth
30/03/22, 7:11:44 PM Yeshwanth ML: It was a long discussion, took time to recall the questions 😂 I'll post it here if I remember any more sir
30/03/22, 7:14:11 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : 👍
30/03/22, 8:02:19 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, I’ll record a video tonight on forward be backward propagation for a shallow neural network that will generalise as a recursive version to a deep neural network. This video will cover the material I discussed today morning and a couple of workshops ago without any errors. Hopefully that will serve as a good resource for you to refer to.

I will follow this up with a from-the-scratch-implementation of a deep neural network to which we will add more layers of complexity such as a dropout and batch normalisation
30/03/22, 8:07:33 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Ok sir

31/03/22, 11:08:50 AM عادل رشيد: Yes that’s why we should embrace neural nets in our souls too. Im going to hang a board like Plato did which was 
“Let no one who is not geometer enter under my roof"
Instead of geometry I’ll write neural networks.
31/03/22, 1:01:18 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, my laptop power port has gone bust. Taking it to the service center now. We will have the NLP workshop today but I might be a bit delayed. Will confirm soon.
31/03/22, 1:02:11 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I'd like all of you to confirm via PM that your have watched and understood the forward and backward propagation video for a generic deep neural network

31/03/22, 2:22:32 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : 👍
31/03/22, 2:33:54 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, just a reminder: No NLP meeting today. My laptop is kaput. We will discuss that tomorrow
31/03/22, 2:34:17 PM Srikanth Shenoy: ok sir
31/03/22, 2:39:13 PM Shridhar: 👍🏻
31/03/22, 3:09:01 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Suppose you are looking at a dataset with dimensionality 10., and you built a deep learning model.  Now you decide to throw away 2 features that you think are not important and implement the exact same DL architecture as before. Which mode will potentially overfit, the one with all 10 features or the one with 8 features?

PM me your answers
31/03/22, 4:16:57 PM Srikanth Shenoy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HA9uY3aJS0
A high level overview of what Elucidata does and where NLP fits in their scheme of things
31/03/22, 4:17:27 PM عادل رشيد: Thanks
31/03/22, 4:17:37 PM Yeshwanth ML: 🙏
31/03/22, 4:17:43 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Great to see some of you rock the answer to this!

Suppose now we use all 10 features as usual and train a DL mode. Your friend decided to use the same architecture as yours but they scale the weights for the layers to lie between -1 and 1. Which model will potentially overfit now, yours or your friend’s?
01/04/22, 9:50:05 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, we will start at 10:30, apologies for the delay
01/04/22, 9:50:30 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Please work on the DL assignments in the meanwhile
01/04/22, 9:50:51 AM Senthil Jacob George: Where will be the class?
01/04/22, 9:51:01 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : AIML lab
01/04/22, 9:51:03 AM عادل رشيد: England
01/04/22, 9:51:10 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Is it occupied?
01/04/22, 9:51:20 AM Senthil Jacob George: Nope
01/04/22, 9:51:23 AM عادل رشيد: I don’t think sir

03/04/22, 10:34:13 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Let me know if you have not received the Teams link
03/04/22, 11:53:25 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Did anyone from AIML give the Nvidia test?
03/04/22, 11:54:04 AM Yeshwanth ML: Yes sir
03/04/22, 11:54:09 AM Yeshwanth ML: Almost all gave
03/04/22, 11:54:53 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : It’s a bit odd that nobody cleared the test
03/04/22, 11:54:57 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Was it that challenging?
03/04/22, 11:55:50 AM Yeshwanth ML: It was c and c++, a bit different compared to what we are familiar with
03/04/22, 11:57:04 AM Pulkit ML: Sir Time management was crucial part ig. That's where I lacked
03/04/22, 11:57:26 AM Yeshwanth ML: One code was in c, I tried but time was not sufficient. Other was c++.
03/04/22, 11:57:47 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Ok can you please summarise what was the focus?
03/04/22, 11:57:51 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Of the test
03/04/22, 11:58:20 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Even though it’s only for a software role and not an ML or DS role, it is better to be prepared
03/04/22, 11:59:22 AM Sayon Whatssapp : Before the last  2 coding questions it took lot  of time in analytical questions. 2 coding questions has more weightage compared to MCQs. Many people were not able to complete the coding questions at last
03/04/22, 11:59:34 AM Yeshwanth ML: Data structures in c. Some questions related to scheduling. Overall mostly focused on hardware programming.
03/04/22, 12:00:18 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Yeah no worries then. But I would have loved for some of you very good at coding to have cleared this test
03/04/22, 12:00:36 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Nevertheless, it’s time to buckle up and be prepared!
03/04/22, 12:00:49 PM Yeshwanth ML: Okay sir
03/04/22, 12:00:58 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Abhay how was it for you?
03/04/22, 12:01:03 PM Abhay ML: Sir questions were actually answerable but don't know why test cases were failing , and given time was tight.

The same code what we wrote there is executing in our system with no issues 😄
03/04/22, 12:01:16 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Ok
03/04/22, 12:14:05 PM عادل رشيد: Did vlsi students also not clear the exams?

03/04/22, 1:33:45 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, even though machine learning or DS jobs don’t require one to code in C or C++ or implement sophisticated data structures, it is imperative that you have a good grip on the basics of programming using C and C++, and understand basic data structures well. Most companies that come through the recruitment office use those as entrance requirements. Please spend a few hours everyday this week to strengthen your basics to that end. I will address this in person when we meet tomorrow.
03/04/22, 1:36:29 PM عادل رشيد: Okay sir
03/04/22, 2:03:13 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I will give a heads up to the next person to join the mock interview meeting

03/04/22, 4:40:26 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Perceptron is like chapter-1 in neural network. Not useful practically! 

It is SVM with 0 margin, that is we just draw a hyper plane between the samples with road width 0. Does that make sense?
03/04/22, 4:41:06 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : ☝🏾 is about perceptron which is like the 1st page in a neural networks book. We never went through it because it is practically useless. Nevertheless know this just in case.
03/04/22, 4:47:25 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : It appears those who have the mock interview today did well on the ML part but were asked to brush up data structures well. We should be grateful to such alumna taking time off on Sunday to help us. Please take that message seriously and work on data structures. If you need help, do not hesitate to reach out to me
03/04/22, 5:03:51 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : One question was if all the weights are same in every node and every layer are same, what will happen?
03/04/22, 5:04:16 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : ☝🏾 good question from mock interview today
03/04/22, 5:04:25 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Pm me your answer

06/04/22, 12:09:35 AM عادل رشيد: This is an interesting read which I found today. Go through this folks,

“JAX is NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU, with great automatic differentiation for high-performance machine learning research.”

https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
06/04/22, 12:10:33 AM عادل رشيد: This is really beautiful 
https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/01-jax-basics.html
06/04/22, 12:11:33 AM عادل رشيد: @919449553675 should shed some light on this. I’m damn sure he must have encountered JAX. It’s like numpy pandas on roids
‎06/04/22, 12:13:09 AM عادل رشيد: ‎image omitted
06/04/22, 12:13:37 AM عادل رشيد: “One of the most commonly used transformations is jax.grad, which takes a numerical function written in Python and returns you a new Python function that computes the gradient of the original function. “
06/04/22, 12:15:56 AM عادل رشيد: @919449553675 sir what’s exactly is functional programming as addressed in the documents of JAX?
06/04/22, 12:19:06 AM Srikanth Shenoy: No idea 🙁
06/04/22, 12:19:20 AM عادل رشيد: But it’s really interesting
06/04/22, 12:19:46 AM عادل رشيد: They aren’t like tensoflow and pytorch and are much flexible in nature

06/04/22, 12:30:09 AM عادل رشيد: Feedback needed from your side btw
06/04/22, 12:30:55 AM عادل رشيد: So this thing works on something called accelerated linear algebra and claims its faster than tensoflow and pytorch
‎06/04/22, 1:11:02 AM عادل رشيد: ‎image omitted
06/04/22, 2:59:26 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, some of you have interviews and related work. All the be at to those.

12/04/22, 3:22:02 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Go through this code. I have also shared via Google Drive. Most of the code involves rendering the output. The core RL part is minimal and easy to understand
12/04/22, 3:25:16 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I will be recording a video later tonight discussing the CartPole environment using this code and the Q-table method for choosing the optimal policy. I will also post a couple of assignment questions following this video.  I'd like you to watch the video and work on the assignments in the lab tomorrow.
12/04/22, 3:26:07 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I have a couple of meetings tomorrow morning, so we will resume our workshop tomorrow afternoon. Will confirm the timing tomorrow noon.
12/04/22, 3:27:01 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : In the meantime, I'd also like you to make some progress on the from-the-scratch neural network code.
12/04/22, 3:27:16 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : See you all tomorrow
12/04/22, 3:27:37 PM عادل رشيد: Okay sir
12/04/22, 3:27:39 PM عادل رشيد: Thanks
12/04/22, 5:10:20 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : If you are unfamiliar with the object oriented approach in this code, reach out to me ASAP. Very soon, we will be implementing a custom environment (class) using Opengym
12/04/22, 6:04:20 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I’m glad some of you responded to this. We will have a session tomorrow to address this
12/04/22, 6:05:19 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Can one of you tell me what gate number is it close to MSIS?
12/04/22, 6:05:39 PM Baswa: 7

12/04/22, 8:49:24 PM عادل رشيد: Gaussian curve
12/04/22, 8:49:33 PM عادل رشيد: Reminds me of aaps class
12/04/22, 8:49:56 PM عادل رشيد: Lets talk to them and ask any data
12/04/22, 8:50:09 PM عادل رشيد: Skewed thou
12/04/22, 8:50:40 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : That is where things get a bit tricky. Getting data is a big challenge from such institutions
12/04/22, 8:51:03 PM Yeshwanth ML: You have two independent random variables X1 and X2 both having gaussian distribution. How do you calculate the joint probability of X1 and X2?
12/04/22, 8:51:54 PM عادل رشيد: I can calculate we studied in digital communication and noise.
1. Take their Fourier and do the convolution
12/04/22, 8:52:24 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Well, what we did in our class might help!
12/04/22, 8:52:47 PM Yeshwanth ML: We just multiply the probabilities since they are independent 😀
12/04/22, 8:52:48 PM عادل رشيد: Yes sir I was telling the other one too
12/04/22, 8:52:56 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Independence = in English?
12/04/22, 8:52:57 PM عادل رشيد: Yes I know this
12/04/22, 8:53:03 PM Yeshwanth ML: This one is like a machine learning riddle
12/04/22, 8:53:23 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : 👍
12/04/22, 8:53:30 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : 👍
12/04/22, 8:53:40 PM Yeshwanth ML: What if they were not independent?
12/04/22, 8:53:50 PM Yeshwanth ML: How do you calculate the probability
12/04/22, 8:54:26 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Anyone?
12/04/22, 8:54:44 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Marginal x conditional
12/04/22, 8:54:57 PM عادل رشيد: Conditional probability then
12/04/22, 8:55:03 PM Yeshwanth ML: Yeah
12/04/22, 8:56:05 PM Yeshwanth ML: P(X1 | X2) * P(X2)
12/04/22, 8:56:13 PM عادل رشيد: Yeah
12/04/22, 8:56:32 PM Yeshwanth ML: Does this hold good is the underlying distribution is not gaussian ?
12/04/22, 8:56:35 PM Yeshwanth ML: Idk this ans
12/04/22, 8:56:48 PM عادل رشيد: I think it’s Gaussian
12/04/22, 8:56:52 PM Srikanth Shenoy: It holds for any distribution.
12/04/22, 8:56:58 PM Yeshwanth ML: If*
12/04/22, 8:57:04 PM Yeshwanth ML: Okay
12/04/22, 8:57:10 PM Yeshwanth ML: Even I think so
12/04/22, 8:57:21 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : 👍
12/04/22, 9:00:48 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Building on Yeshwanth’s question, if X1 and X2 are multivariate Gaussian distributed, the man X1 and X2 separately are university Gaussian distributed
12/04/22, 9:01:14 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : That makes the Multivariate Gaussian distribution a very appealing thing to deal with
12/04/22, 9:03:50 PM عادل رشيد: Also the concept of isocontours will take place too if my memory serves right
12/04/22, 9:04:15 PM عادل رشيد: Where we calculate the value of  x meu and sigma
12/04/22, 9:04:36 PM عادل رشيد: Then for higher dim
12/04/22, 9:04:45 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Yes, those are the ellipses we saw for the father-son height dataset
12/04/22, 9:04:50 PM عادل رشيد: We do linear transformation
12/04/22, 9:04:54 PM عادل رشيد: Yes sir
12/04/22, 9:05:21 PM عادل رشيد: Linear algebra is amazing! Now im able to connect the dots
12/04/22, 9:05:54 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Yes, multivariate Gaussian is all of linear algebra
12/04/22, 9:06:01 PM عادل رشيد: Yes sir I remember it
12/04/22, 9:06:42 PM عادل رشيد: We used to do linear transformation and then factorize the covariance mat and change the variables
12/04/22, 9:06:58 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : That’s right
12/04/22, 9:07:00 PM عادل رشيد: I mean I do remember the mathematics involved
12/04/22, 9:07:18 PM عادل رشيد: But what does it mean to do this is where I struggled lol
12/04/22, 9:07:25 PM عادل رشيد: And why we used to do this
12/04/22, 9:07:33 PM عادل رشيد: Hopefully all this will be cleared soon
12/04/22, 9:07:35 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Actually Mahalanobis is the same, showed this to Senthil
12/04/22, 9:07:39 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : 👍
12/04/22, 9:07:42 PM عادل رشيد: Okay sir
12/04/22, 9:08:07 PM عادل رشيد: Did we use svd to factorize the covariance mat
12/04/22, 9:08:19 PM عادل رشيد: Isn’t it ?
12/04/22, 9:08:22 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Eigendecompostion
12/04/22, 9:08:26 PM عادل رشيد: Ah yes
12/04/22, 9:08:30 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Cause covariance matrix is symmetric
12/04/22, 9:08:34 PM عادل رشيد: Yes
12/04/22, 9:08:37 PM عادل رشيد: Agreed
12/04/22, 9:08:39 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : It is equivalent to SVd though
12/04/22, 9:08:47 PM عادل رشيد: Svd is for unsymmetrical ones
12/04/22, 9:09:00 PM Yeshwanth ML: Ohh
12/04/22, 9:09:06 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Yes
12/04/22, 9:09:07 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Nothing like that
12/04/22, 9:09:26 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Sqwuare unsymmetric nmatrices can have eigen they wont be orthogonal
12/04/22, 9:09:44 PM Srikanth Shenoy: I thought so
12/04/22, 9:10:27 PM عادل رشيد: Svd is majorly used for unsymmetrical afaik
12/04/22, 9:10:39 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : That’s right Sir, but certain matrices (called defective matrices) do not have an eogenvalue decomposition but all matrices are guaranteed to have an SVD decomposition
12/04/22, 9:10:56 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Ohh ok sir
12/04/22, 9:11:02 PM عادل رشيد: Oh i see
12/04/22, 9:11:12 PM عادل رشيد: That’s why svd was used in glrn
12/04/22, 9:11:17 PM عادل رشيد: *glrm
12/04/22, 9:11:25 PM Yeshwanth ML: Ohh
12/04/22, 9:11:43 PM Srikanth Shenoy: SVD is closed form though. GLRM is numerical
12/04/22, 9:11:59 PM عادل رشيد: Okay
12/04/22, 9:12:05 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : SVD is used for initialising the X, Y matrices in GLRM
12/04/22, 9:12:35 PM عادل رشيد: Yea sir
12/04/22, 9:12:36 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Also, SVD gives a low dimensional representation of the underlying matrix that we can leverage on when initialising
12/04/22, 9:13:04 PM Yeshwanth ML: Sir do we have glrm in curriculum this sem??
12/04/22, 9:13:20 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Yes Yeshwanth…
12/04/22, 9:13:25 PM Yeshwanth ML: Ohh okay
12/04/22, 9:13:28 PM Yeshwanth ML: Cool
12/04/22, 9:13:33 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Is it where they they do A = X (sigma)^1/2 * (sigma)^1/2Y
12/04/22, 9:13:37 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : And for the relief of others, we will no go that deep
12/04/22, 9:13:45 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : It will be at an application level only
12/04/22, 9:13:54 PM Yeshwanth ML: 😂
12/04/22, 9:14:03 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : That’s right Sir
12/04/22, 9:17:21 PM Yeshwanth ML: It gets confusing at times
12/04/22, 9:17:22 PM عادل رشيد: Im yet to touch the surface sir
12/04/22, 9:17:29 PM Yeshwanth ML: Yeah me too
12/04/22, 9:17:54 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Like wise... just scratching the surface 😂
12/04/22, 9:18:02 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : It is a fairly complicated algorithm. It’s application is a lot of fun though
12/04/22, 9:18:37 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Linear algebra will age like old wine. Keep up the momentum; some point, it will be your lens to the world
12/04/22, 9:19:46 PM Yeshwanth ML: Yeah we are like just born now.
12/04/22, 9:20:38 PM عادل رشيد: Im a novice sir
12/04/22, 9:20:47 PM عادل رشيد: Couldn’t agree more
12/04/22, 9:21:18 PM عادل رشيد: Keeping up with linear algebra
12/04/22, 9:32:00 PM Yeshwanth ML: https://youtu.be/JjB58InuTqM
12/04/22, 9:32:34 PM عادل رشيد: Isn’t in this series he used octave or so
12/04/22, 9:33:07 PM Yeshwanth ML: This is very similar mahalanobis distance application
12/04/22, 9:33:39 PM Yeshwanth ML: Not sure I found it randomly
12/04/22, 9:33:55 PM عادل رشيد: Okay
12/04/22, 9:34:23 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : It is indeed!
12/04/22, 9:34:36 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Good recap of our lecture on multivariate normal distribution
12/04/22, 9:34:56 PM Yeshwanth ML: I believe it’s a part of the machine learning specialisation. He seem to have covered literally everything in that.
12/04/22, 9:35:16 PM Yeshwanth ML: Yes sir we can relate it to our graph
12/04/22, 9:35:22 PM Yeshwanth ML: It’s same
12/04/22, 9:36:33 PM عادل رشيد: Yes its his old ML series
12/04/22, 9:44:30 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Old is gold
12/04/22, 9:44:39 PM Yeshwanth ML: 😀
12/04/22, 9:44:46 PM عادل رشيد: Anyday sir
12/04/22, 9:46:04 PM Yeshwanth ML: I just watched both the videos the equation he used is same as mahalanobis distance. It was a good recap. We had seen it much detail in class.
12/04/22, 9:46:31 PM Yeshwanth ML: For some reason he doesn’t use the term mahalanobis
12/04/22, 9:46:53 PM عادل رشيد: Maybe he is jealous of using indian name
12/04/22, 9:47:04 PM Yeshwanth ML: 😂😂😂😂
12/04/22, 9:47:26 PM عادل رشيد: Time to bring back old indian legacy of nalanda and co
12/04/22, 9:47:46 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : That’s true Yeshwanth. He is using the idea of the joint PDF directly to estimate outliers. But that boils down to the same as what we did with Mahalanobis distance
12/04/22, 9:48:03 PM Senthil Jacob George: Takshashila
12/04/22, 9:48:09 PM Yeshwanth ML: Ohh okay sir
12/04/22, 9:48:23 PM عادل رشيد: Indus valley
12/04/22, 9:48:28 PM عادل رشيد: Okay sir
12/04/22, 9:48:32 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : An interesting idea would be take Yeshwanth’s code for embedding categorical variables and then look at the distribution of the newly formed features. Even if they are not normal, MD can give some insight into outliers
12/04/22, 9:48:57 PM عادل رشيد: Okay sir
12/04/22, 9:49:11 PM Yeshwanth ML: Yeah I’ll share the code here sir. One i did for house price
12/04/22, 9:49:27 PM عادل رشيد: Thanks

12/04/22, 9:51:44 PM Yeshwanth ML: Yeah this is waht I used
12/04/22, 9:52:00 PM عادل رشيد: Nice
12/04/22, 9:52:37 PM Yeshwanth ML: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QQ8chVZKi8wtfOrUvk4Synx1NRlJXqG4?usp=sharing
12/04/22, 9:53:13 PM Srikanth Shenoy: 👌👌
12/04/22, 9:53:34 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Very nice. Suraksha and team, this will be your base code for your project
12/04/22, 9:53:44 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : With Yeshwanth’s kind permission of course

12/04/22, 9:54:28 PM Yeshwanth ML: 😂😂😂😂
12/04/22, 9:54:45 PM عادل رشيد: Lmao where did you get the dataset
12/04/22, 9:54:53 PM عادل رشيد: BTM and all 😀😀
12/04/22, 9:55:01 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Sir, the newly added features for embeddings will not have any distribution. They will be just fixed entries from the generated embedding replacing each of the discrete categorical variables. What am I missing sir?
12/04/22, 9:55:05 PM Yeshwanth ML: using these weights to create a columns was a challenge though
12/04/22, 9:55:17 PM Yeshwanth ML: scraped it from nobroker
12/04/22, 9:55:27 PM عادل رشيد: Oh nice
12/04/22, 9:56:08 PM Yeshwanth ML: Yeah. I'll share that as well if you want
12/04/22, 9:56:17 PM عادل رشيد: Sure
12/04/22, 9:56:24 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : That’s right Sir; if we were to imagine the categories as infinitely many, that might induce a distribution. Or may not even in that case. Was referring to that
12/04/22, 9:56:26 PM عادل رشيد: But I’ll try this on mice dataset
12/04/22, 9:56:48 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Ok sir. understood 🙏
12/04/22, 9:57:16 PM Yeshwanth ML: yeah some categories had 10 values. so it might have a gaussian distribution.
12/04/22, 9:58:22 PM Suraksha Rao: Okay sir, will go through the code
12/04/22, 10:00:16 PM Srikanth Shenoy: R has this one liner function call to test normality - Shapiro Wilk test. Pretty interesting
12/04/22, 10:00:58 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : That is an awesome test Sir

12/04/22, 10:03:30 PM Yeshwanth ML: I should learn about these tests
12/04/22, 10:03:40 PM Yeshwanth ML: seems really important
12/04/22, 10:04:11 PM عادل رشيد: Is there anything as such in python too
12/04/22, 10:04:51 PM عادل رشيد: Here we go
https://www.statology.org/shapiro-wilk-test-python/
12/04/22, 10:05:02 PM عادل رشيد: Scipy is pretty goated library
12/04/22, 10:05:07 PM Yeshwanth ML: third party libraries in python are bad. you can search for some code in github.
12/04/22, 10:05:19 PM عادل رشيد: I don’t think its third party
12/04/22, 10:05:52 PM Yeshwanth ML: kk
12/04/22, 10:06:12 PM عادل رشيد: Scipy is standard library isn’t it?
12/04/22, 10:06:25 PM Yeshwanth ML: I didn't notice it was scipy
12/04/22, 10:07:29 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Sir, I would have loved to touch upon those things which are actually not in the syllabus. I’m looking at an applied flavour for wider appeal!
12/04/22, 10:08:09 PM عادل رشيد: Okay sir
12/04/22, 10:09:02 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Ok sir
13/04/22, 8:35:17 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : We have the CEO and CTO of VuNet Systems visiting us today. They will have an interaction session with the students. If you are interested, please show up to the AIML lab at 11 AM. We will have the RL workshop in the afternoon.
13/04/22, 10:54:12 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : VuNet folks are in the AIML lab. Please join if you are interested.

13/04/22, 6:11:09 PM عادل رشيد: @919449553675 went through shapiro anderson darling etc but again all these aren't enough to test normality of the data and all.
13/04/22, 6:11:38 PM عادل رشيد: This post has explained this subtle point in  a baeautiful fashion
13/04/22, 6:11:42 PM Srikanth Shenoy: oh!! I didnt know
13/04/22, 6:11:52 PM عادل رشيد: Yeah sir
13/04/22, 6:12:36 PM عادل رشيد: So in a nutshell there is no way you can surely say which data is which it depends upon lots of parameter
13/04/22, 6:13:10 PM عادل رشيد: This is the magnus opus of various posts and articles I read give these
13/04/22, 6:16:21 PM عادل رشيد: Shapiro–Wilk test,
D'Agostino's K-squared test,
Anderson–Darling test,
Cramér–von Mises criterion,
Lilliefors test,
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test,
Jarque–Bera test, and
Pearson's chi-squared test.

13/04/22, 6:26:44 PM عادل رشيد: these are on my fraud watch list too.
13/04/22, 6:33:23 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Andrey Kolmogorov was one of the top 5 mathematicians of the 20th century with too many contributions across many branches of math/stat. Cant write off his contributions with one stroke. There may be situations where it is not suitable (very less sample, too many samples). That may be a known case with these tests isnt it?
13/04/22, 6:34:12 PM عادل رشيد: Yeah actually the sample size matters a lot in all these tests.
13/04/22, 6:34:45 PM عادل رشيد: I rate you more than andrey! I believe in subjective morality :p
13/04/22, 6:36:42 PM عادل رشيد: What i feel is whole statistics field is joke. This limitations that limitations etc. imagine studying so much to know this gentlemen algorithms can’t be used with closed eyes. Then its better to make one which can do it with closed eyes
13/04/22, 6:52:55 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : 😃 Kolmogorov must be rolling in his grave
13/04/22, 6:54:32 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : A gentle reminder that all that is packaged as machine learning is nothin but statistics!

Using an algorithm with closed eyes is as good as deciding to walk across a stream that is on an average only half feet deep. Good luck!
13/04/22, 6:55:12 PM عادل رشيد: 😬😬😬
13/04/22, 6:55:26 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Statistical tests are powerful tools when one knows where they are applicable. There is no unified statistical theory because data is inherently random
13/04/22, 6:55:40 PM عادل رشيد: Yea sir obviously
13/04/22, 6:56:44 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Anyways, I’m glad that some of you showed up to the VuNet interaction session. They were happy about the questions you had posed
13/04/22, 6:57:12 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Also, a bit disappointed at some not showing up; to such sessions and to the workshops as well.
13/04/22, 6:58:29 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : As for the upcoming exams, I have decided to make them challenging; so far, the difficulty level has been 0.1 on a 1-10 scale. This will help me identify the really motivated ones
13/04/22, 6:59:06 PM Senthil Jacob George: 0.1😱
13/04/22, 6:59:23 PM Yeshwanth ML: We were glad to talk with them sir. Thanks for calling them, they patiently answered everyone and it’s good to speak with industry leaders.

Eat well before the DL exam because there will be food for thought!
18/04/22, 12:35:03 PM عادل رشيد: 😅😅😅
18/04/22, 4:15:58 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I'm a bit disappointed that some of you had access to the question paper PDF from last year. Anyways, the flip side is that the next exam will be challenging from bottom up!
18/04/22, 5:15:54 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Ok I just realised I had shown the question paper during one of the lectures. My apologies folks, i should have know me wel. I’m glad some of you are paying attention!
18/04/22, 5:22:44 PM Yeshwanth ML: Suraksha’s observation skills are exceptional

19/04/22, 4:08:17 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, hope the MLPA test was interesting enough today.

The RL test tomorrow will hover around the idea of state space, action space, transition probabilities, rewards, Markov decision process
19/04/22, 4:39:53 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Ok sir
20/04/22, 11:47:16 AM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, hope you enjoyed the RL test. The second problem is straight out of a Berkeley exam.  You should be happy if you could crack it.

21/04/22, 1:38:46 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : PM me your answer: A student has two routes to campus. Each route has a random duration. The student prefers Route A because its expected duration is 15 minutes compared to 20 minutes for Route B. However, on 10% of her trips she is forced to take Route B because of road work on Route A. On the remaining 90% of the days she takes Route A.

What is the expected duration of her trip on a random day?
21/04/22, 7:17:53 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Those who came to the workshop today probably realised the importance of this question.

Please make sure you understand (1) linearity of expectation (2) expectation using conditioning (3) conditioning on multiple events (4) state-value function in terms of actuon1value function (Bellman equation) and vice versa.

We had a whiteboard session today afternoon. Reach out to folks who were there if you missed it.

I’m also looking forward to the Bellman equation to linear system conversion. I hope one of you can crack that!

02/05/22, 9:13:29 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, I appreciate the feedback from folks today at the RL class that it would help to have the lectures/workshops in the forenoon session and have the afternoon session free for self-work at the lab or placement preparations.
02/05/22, 9:16:12 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Keeping this in mind, we will have the next RL workshop on Wednesday from 8:30-10 AM followed by the AAPS workshop from 11:10 AM-12 PM and again an RL workshop from 12-1 PM. I understand this will be intense, for you and me as well! But that would leave you free for the afternoon. Hope that would work for all.
02/05/22, 9:16:31 PM عادل رشيد: All in sir
02/05/22, 9:16:55 PM عادل رشيد: We will have whole other half day free sir and no sleepy afternoon session 😅😅
02/05/22, 9:17:24 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Please note that you will also have the CNN lecture on Wednesday from 10-11 AM. That leaves you with just a 10-minute break for the whole session starting 8:30 AM
02/05/22, 9:18:15 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : I'd be happy to see the few folks still hanging on to be awake!
02/05/22, 9:18:32 PM عادل رشيد: 😅😅
02/05/22, 9:52:55 PM Srikanth Shenoy: The null hypothesis H_0 = students will not be awake will be rejected sir 😅
02/05/22, 9:53:44 PM عادل رشيد: But we need to calculate the P value first and define the threshold

03/05/22, 10:43:11 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Hi all, I’m a bit neck deep with the grading. I will resume the workshops from Thursday. 

On Thursday 9-10 AM, we will have AAPS followed by 30-minute break and the. 10:30 AM-1:30 PM will be the RL workshop.

Afternoon, you can work in the lab or prepare for placements.
03/05/22, 10:43:47 PM عادل رشيد: Thanks sir
03/05/22, 10:43:50 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : From Thursday onward, we will stick to this morning schedule mostly
03/05/22, 10:45:13 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : For RL, I appreciate the very few of you putting in the effort. I’m not sure how others are doing. Anyways, if you are interested in the material at all, please try to go through what we have discussed so far and reach out to me if you have any questions. In particular, I’d like you to be comfortable with the Bellman equations for the state value and action value functions.
03/05/22, 10:45:53 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : In any case, the RL exam will not be straightforward even with a good understanding of the material. Please keep that in mind a

03/05/22, 11:07:52 PM عادل رشيد: Okay sir
03/05/22, 11:08:19 PM Pulkit ML: ok sir
04/05/22, 10:10:54 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Couture AI is definitely an interesting company doing ML product development.
I am deducing the following info by looking at their website, portfolio description, job description for open positions:

They have core engineering positions. The company is trying to be "Spring Framework" of Machine Learning.
i.e. they are developing a layer on top of all other ML tools, integrating them together, reducing the learning curve and complexity....thus provide a wrapper from step 1 - data ingestion till last step - deployment, execution, observabilty, MLOps and for everything in between (perhaps both on and off cloud) as one stop shop.
so that other companies that are just starting on ML with less experienced and less paid staff can buy Couture product and will be able to deploy ML models in production in cloud easily in a well defined manner using the best practices based implementation ingrained in the Couture product

This job is ideal for somebody who is interested in touching all aspects of machine learning lifecycle from a software development lifecycle perspective (but not from actually doing machine learning from a day to day perspective) . There will be lots of coding and tool integration using open source and propreitary APIs
Their product does multi source data ingestion, big data with Spark, serious software development in multiple languages, developing tools for the cloud, deploying on the cloud using the tools that hook onto AWS/GCP/Azure etc. ML Tool Intergration and a readymade and stable ML tool chain setup seems to be their USP
04/05/22, 10:17:28 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Awesome Sir, this is super helpful
04/05/22, 10:22:39 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : This looks like a sophisticated pipeline job cutting across different software; I hope folks interested I this get a chance here. 🙏🏿 Sir
04/05/22, 10:25:01 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Prospects also look good sir. Smaller company, have a lot of IIT hires in the past 3 years. Have a customer base/footprint in EU. Engineering Mgr positions are paid 40-70lakh pa. Perhaps good VC funding too
04/05/22, 10:26:09 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : Sounds great Sir. I’m sure some of our folks will crack it!

11/05/22, 7:55:37 AM عادل رشيد: A/B testing includes hypothesis testing as a component, but generally refers to experimentation in an industry setting where the data is coming from an online process.  While many elements are the same as in other settings (e.g. hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, p-values, power analysis), there are some very important differences because online settings make things weird.

For example, what should the unit of your experiment be?  Imagine you're at Buzzfeed and testing a UX change to news article pages.  You could choose to show the treatment to logged-in users, but presumably most people who read Buzzfeed articles aren't logged in.  This would limit the generalizability of the experiment.  You could also choose to randomize based on tracking cookie.  You'd get higher volume and a more representative sample, but the same person could end up seeing both the treatment and control experiences!  Like, what if the same person reads Buzzfeed on their desktop computer and their mobile device?  Or if the user opens multiple incognito windows?  If you're a biologist testing how mice respond to a drug in a lab, you know exactly how many mice you have and can ensure you know which treatment(s) each mouse is receiving.  However, if you're testing on cookies, you don't actually know how many people you're testing on.

There are also a variety of other concerns.  Like, suppose you're testing at Facebook.  The treatment group receives a minor UI change with the goal of improving the number of times they message someone on their friends lists.  But if a treatment group user talks to their friend in the control group, that impacts the number of messages sent by the control group!  A completely random assignment of users would therefore violate the stable unit treatment assumption (SUTVA), which assumes that someone's response to their treatment in the experiment depends only on their own treatment.  Social network websites have published a variety of papers on how to handle this situation, including how to quantify network effects and on how to assign based on trying to ensure network separation between groups.

Also, unlike other settings, A/B testing often focuses on whether the percent change was statistically significant because baseline values can be super low (e.g. we might be aiming for a third-decimal point improvement in clickthrough rate like 0.103 -> 0.104).  Unlike for difference of means, there’s no named hypothesis test for percent change.  You also can't divide the confidence interval by the control group values because you're dividing by a random variable and not taking that additional variability into account.  So you need specialized math for percent change calculations.

I haven't even scratched the surface of just how much online A/B testing differs from other experiment settings.  If you want to learn more about A/B testing and online-specific concerns, I highly recommend reading Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments by Kohavi et al.  It's not super technical and is a fantastic introduction.  I've recommended it to new hires with strong stats backgrounds at my current job and they found it really useful for understanding why what we do is different from experimentation in more traditional settings, like behavioral labs or in agriculture.

11/05/22, 3:35:02 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : We will have an in-lab RL problem & coding session tomorrow from 10:30-12:30. Each one will work independently on the problems and code on their own parallelly with me.

13/05/22, 9:32:32 PM Srikanth Shenoy: Apparently OpenGym by default does not work for Windows. Only Linux and Mac. A Linux is needed on Windows either as a Windows Subsystem for Linux, Docker, or Virtual Box.
There is an alternate method in this video and it worked on Windows for me without Linux. But it needs installation of Visual Studio C++ Build Tools as the first step. A bandwidth guzzler of 1.5 GB by itself. And then the another 0.5 GB for gym install.

22/05/22, 10:08:00 PM Yeshwanth ML: Yes sir suneha was saying they implement complex algorithms, sometimes more complex than neural networks. Depending on the problem they have to do. They don’t have any limits
22/05/22, 10:09:40 PM Yeshwanth ML: ‎This message was deleted.
22/05/22, 10:10:03 PM Yeshwanth ML: “Yeah, NN is being used in few places...

But as per my experience, some of the problems being solved are quite complex for NN... We often need to go beyond that ..”
22/05/22, 10:26:15 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : That’s true; learning a new algorithm and implementing it right away is an important skill that I see in some of you.
22/05/22, 10:26:35 PM Professor Sudarsan N S Acharya : That would a great skill in the industry that is evolving w.r.t. ML
22/05/22, 10:48:02 PM Srikanth Shenoy: True sir. Implementing algorithms from papers that are handwavy and involving high dimensional tensors etc. particularly becomes very confusing, errorprone and time consuming

So this is the final pandas one.It is in ten small parts topic wise which I have tried to put in a sorted way.Last one is very interesting as it deals with time analysis in pandas.
There are two  notebooks in some folders one is called snippets where small data is used to  explain the major functions of pandas .second one I used stackoverflow data which I downloaded from a link (its in the first notebook)
I hope it may benefit one and all.
